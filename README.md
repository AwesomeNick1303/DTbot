# DTbot
I'm just a 12 year old who wants to make a client-side bot for Dubtrack. I named it DTbot. Feel free to use it if you want.

###Bookmarks Bar Setup:

1. Right click on said bookmarks bar

2. Click "Add page" or whatever it is on your browser

3. For the URL paste this in:
**javascript:(function(){$.getScript("https:/[]()/pastebin.com/raw.php?i=2a1qa1wC");}())**

4. Name the bookmark whatever you want it to be

5. Click on the bookmark when you're on whatever Dubtrack room you wanna be in

6. Profit
